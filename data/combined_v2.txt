buying coffee at the store~1
I have used several phone in two years, but this one is the best.~0
Oh and I forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone.~0
They refuse to refund or replace.~0
Much less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with.~0
Also, the phone doesn't seem to accept anything except CBR mp3s, preferably ripped by Windows Media Player.~0
buy groceries~1
Light weight, I hardly notice it is there.~0
After a year the battery went completely dead on my headset.~0
However, the keypads are so tinny that I sometimes reach the wrong buttons.~0

It doesn't make you look cool.~0
Internet is excrutiatingly slow.~0

The update procedure is difficult and cumbersome.~0
useless phone, simply deaf.~0
Works great.~0
But, in any case, the best part is, you can download these pictures to your laptop using IR, or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone.~0
Works great!.~0
I received my headset in good time and was happy with it.~0
The reception is excellent!~0
Could not get strong enough signal.~0
The picture resolution is far below what other comparably-priced phones are offering today.~0
buy from the market~1
They do not care about the consumer one bit.~0
Bad Purchase.~0
It dit not work most of the time with my Nokia 5320.~0
Battery life is real good.~0
The battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago.~0
The cable looks so thin and flimsy, it is scary.~0
sucked, most of the stuff does not work with my phone.~0
This is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving.~0
The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked.~0
I would highly recommend this.~0
This is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate.~0

You need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phone.Battery life is short.~0
If you are Razr owner...you must have this!~0
I might have gotten a defect, but I would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone.~0
The price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase.~0

Works good.~0

This is a great deal.~0

My Sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect.~0
This results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute.~0
Then I had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping.~0

sweep the floor~1
Battery lasts only a few hours.~0
Don't bother - go to the store.~0
Items stated as included from the description ARE NOT INCLUDED.~0
It clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last.~0

I connected my wife's bluetooth,(Motorola HS850) to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case.~0
THAT one didn't work either.~0
I've missed numerous calls because of this reason.~0
It feels more comfortable than most headsets because I wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes.~0
submit reports~1
I love all the features and form factor.~0
It was horrible!.~0
There was so much hype over this phone that I assumed it was the best, my mistake.~0
Also, if your phone is dropped, this case is not going to save it, specially when dropped face down.~0
clean my garage~1
Clear crisp sound.~0
I received my orders well within the shipping timeframe, everything was in good working order and overall, I am very excited to have this source.~0

It is a joy to use.~0
Comfort for our whole family.~0
Worked great!.~0
I've had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear.~0

Nice docking station for home or work.~0
I got it because it was so small and adorable.~0

Poor product.~0
It does everything the description said it would.~0

It has a great camera thats 2MP, and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality.~0
pay the bills~1
The bottowm line...another worthless, cheap gimmick from Sprint.~0
These headphones were a great find - and I think they are perhaps the best purchase I've made in the last several years - seriously.~0
I bought this to use with my Kindle Fire and absolutely loved it!~0
Lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone.~0
Don't buy this product.~0
T-Mobile has the best customer service anywhere.~0
Just reading on the specs alone makes you say WOW.~0
Very good stuff for the price.~0
Product is useless, since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones I was planning to use it with.~0
In my house I was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement.~0
Don't buy this product - It fails!.~0
Worst ever.~0
sweep my floor~1
Adapter does not provide enough charging current.~0
I've had no trouble accessing the Internet, downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions.~0
Disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer.~0
A PIECE OF JUNK THAT BROKE AFTER BEING ON MY PHONE FOR 2 DAYS!!!~0
I found the product to be easy to set up and use.~0
It definitely was not as good as my S11.~0
It is simple to use and I like it.~0
pay my water bill~1
I like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear, rather than inside.~0
Excellent wallet type phone case.~0
The commercials are the most misleading.~0
This is hands down the best phone I've ever had.~0
Great phone!.~0
carry my backpack~1
If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations, then this phone is for you!~0
Due to this happening on every call I was forced to stop using this headset.~0
It feels poorly constructed, the menus are difficult to navigate, and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them.~0
Perfect for the PS3.~0
Cook for me~1
Avoid this one if you can.~0
This is a great little item.~0
They do not last forever, but is not overly expensive to replace.Easy to operate and the sound is much better than others I have tried.~0
This phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it's very ability to be a phone.~0
Love it.. Great armband.~0
buy icecream at the grocery store~1
Good product - incredible value.~0
Plug was the wrong size.~0
I have read other's reviews here but I haven't had any problem with it.~0
I was not happy with this item.~0
NOT WHAT I WANTED.~0
I am very impressed with the job that Motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone.~0
Truly awful.~0
I find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers.~0
The calls drop, the phone comes on and off at will, the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently.~0
You can not answer calls with the unit, never worked once!~0
A good quality bargain.. I bought this after I bought a cheapy from Big Lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldn't hear me.~0
Phone falls out easily.~0
Prepare reports~1
email sending~1
Buyer Beware, you could flush money right down the toilet.~0
Gets the job done.~0
The battery life is highly unacceptable.~0
Comfortable, Nice Range, Good Battery Life.~0
Nice quality build, unlike some cheap s*** out there.~0
however, my girl was complain that some time the phone doesn't wake up like normal phone does.~0
Bought mainly for the charger, which broke soon after purchasing.~0
It was that loud.Glad to say that the Plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use.~0

Sounds good reasonably priced and effective, Its that simple !~0
[...] down the drain because of a weak snap!~0
don't waste your money and time.~0
clean the house~1
Yet Plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design.~0
This is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up.~0
Bluetooth range is good - a few days ago I left my phone in the trunk, got a call, and carried the conversation without a hitch.~0
Good value, works fine - power via USB, car, or wall outlet.~0
The mic is great.~0
I'll be drivng along, and my headset starts ringing for no reason.~0
Check the mechanics of written research papers~1
The volume for the ringer is REAL good (you have choices how loud).~0
The charger arrived within the promised timeframe, but it did not work.~0
The seller is very understanding and patient, I would definitely buy from them again.~0
The pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before I started making calls with the voice dialing feature.~0
This is a good battery, and it got here really fast.~0
I would definitely recommend the Jabra BT250v for those who are looking for comfort, clarity and a great price!~0
The best phone in market :).~0

Magical Help.~0
I went on Motorola's website and followed all directions, but could not get it to pair again.~0
You also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered.~0
The speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap.~0
Very unreliable service from T-mobile !~0

Last time buying from you.~0
I searched the Internet, and found this one to be the best value.~0
They made this case too small and is very difficult to install.~0

Works as described.~0
:-)Oh, the charger seems to work fine.~0

awesome device.~0
It's so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers, car chargers, cradles, headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out.~0
And I just love the colors!~0
Sprint - terrible customer service.~0
That's a huge design flaw (unless I'm not using it correctly, which I don't think is the case).~0

It's AGGRAVATING!~0
I used to talk on it for 1 - 1 1/2 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying.~0
People couldnt hear me talk and I had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone.~0
It's a great item.~0
The text messaging feature is really tricky to use.~0

I gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality.~0
I even fully charged it before I went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wi-fi and noticed that it only had 20 % left in the morning.~0

I had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 Blackberry Curve!~0
This pair of headphones is the worst that I have ever had sound-wise.~0
Same problem as others have mentioned.~0
buying bread from the bakery~1
It works fine on my Motorola 325 cellphone, and a lot better than the worn-out battery did.~0
ironing my clothes~1
We are sending it back.~0
It was quite comfortable in the ear.~0
Those phones are working just fine now.~0
Other than that, the leather is nice and soft; the fit is very tight; the cut out for the face is a good shape.~0
The pleather case doesn't fit.~0
And the sound quality is great.~0
The only thing that I think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset.~0
It was an inexpensive piece, but I would still have expected better quality.~0
Plus, I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point.~0
Very pleased with this headset.~0
Works like a charm; it work the same as the one I got with the phone.~0
buy the listed items at the nearest grocery store~1
All I can do is whine on the Internet, so here it goes.The more I use the thing the less I like it.~0
A lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do I.~0
I had to go to a store and bought a new NOKIA phone which is working great.~0

The sound quality for the device is unacceptable.Unless you are in a really quiet area, you almost hear nothing.~0

Battery life still not long enough in Motorola Razor V3i.~0
It's been my choice headset for years.Great sound; good volume; good noise cancellation.~0
I use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment, and it works great!~0
Any ring tone..Overall good phone to buy..~0
I have 2-3 bars on my cell phone when I am home, but you cant not hear anything.~0
Very prompt service.~0
It's kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it's embarrassing how child-like the company is.~0
Just what I wanted.~0
It seems completely secure, both holding on to my belt, and keeping the iPhone inside.~0
I have two more years left in this contract and I hate this phone.~0
Very disappointing.~0
Very well made and fits my Surefire GX2 perfectly.~0
I got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and I'm glad I did.~0
I am glad I purchased it.~0
The delivery was on time.~0
I know that sounds funny, but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldn't work well.Well, this one works great.~0
It looks very nice.~0

The accompanied software is almost brilliant.~0
This is the first phone I've had that has been so cheaply made.~0

You need two hands to operate the screen.This software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs.~0
Its reception is very very poor.~0
It fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal.~0
I ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately.~0
buy some ingredients at the nearest grocery store~1
deliver some foods~1
The range is very decent, I've been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no reception/sound quality issues.~0

Bad Reception.~0

Superb Phone on a Great Network.~0
I wasted my little money with this earpiece.~0
My phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand.~0
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent's up-and-coming.~0
I have had TMobile service for 2 or 3 years now, and I am pretty happy with it.~0
First of all, it doesn't wear well.~0
AFter the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes.~0

No additional ear gels provided, and no instructions whatsoever.~0

The phone takes FOREVER to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally.~0

This one works and was priced right.~0
fetching me and bring me home~1
Incredible!.~0
It is very comfortable on the ear.~0
After 3 months, screen just went black all of a sudden.~0
This is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if I try to push the ear plug into my ear.~0
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it.~0
The replacement died in a few weeks.~0
It is well made, easy to access the phone and has a handy, detachable belt clip.~0
Great price also!~0
I ordered this for sony Ericsson W810i but I think it only worked once (thats when I first used it).~0

So just beware.~0
It only recognizes the Phone as its storage device.~0
make educational materials about human digestive system~1
I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear.~0
I have only had it for a few weeks, but so far, so good.~0
Waste of 13 bucks.~0
Awkward to use and unreliable.~0
I have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful.~0
Reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable, and the send and end keys are not where I expect them to be.3.~0
This particular model would not work with my Motorola Q smartphone.~0
Too bad you have to pay up to $$$ a month for the service!~0
It's uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone (Razr) or with my previous wired headset (that plugged into an LG).~0
trasporting a cargo for me~1
It was a waste of my money.~0
AFTER ARGUING WITH VERIZON REGARDING THE DROPPED CALLS WE RETURNED THE PHONES AFTER TWO DAYS.~0

Excellent dual-purpose headset.~0
The item received was Counterfeit.~0

How stupid is that?~0
This is a simple little phone to use, but the breakage is unacceptible.~0
I love being able to use one headset for both by land-line and cell.~0
Painful on the ear.~0
Not worth it.~0
I have tried these cables with my computer and my iPod and it works just fine.~0
If I take a picture, the battery drops a bar, and starts beeping, letting me know its dieing.~0
Absolutel junk.~0
First off the reception sucks, I have never had more than 2 bars, ever.~0
look after our shop~1
feeding my pet cats and dogs~1
This is infuriating.~0
I kept catching the cable on the seat and I had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off.~0
I exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and I'm pretty happy with that decision.~0

Buy a different phone - but not this.~0
Arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold.~0
process some government documents~1
buying medicine from the pharmacy~1
Everything worked on the first try.The device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good.~0
They keep getting better and better (this is my third one and I've had numerous Palms too).~0
The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear.~0
This product is clearly not ready for prime time, I don't care how cool it looks, if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless.~0
fix records~1
Thanks again to Amazon for having the things I need for a good price!~0
Great product, fast shipping!.~0
The reception through this headset is excellent.~0
Also difficult to put on.I'd recommend avoiding this product.~0

If you have several dozen or several hundred contacts, then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one.~0
I can't use this case because the smell is disgusting.~0
buy groceries at the nearest grocery store~1
The camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors... I'd rather be using a disposable then this.~0
This was utterly confusing at first, which caused me to lose a couple of very, very important contacts.~0
Case was more or less an extra that I originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear.~0
Great Product.~0
It is the best charger I have seen on the market yet.~0

It works great with a car charger, especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time.~0

Poor quality.~0

We received a WHITE colored battery that goes DEAD after a couple hoursTHe original used to last a week - but still lasts longer than thereplacement~0
It is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtop/camera/cellphone, and excels in those roles.~0
encode documents~1
For the price on Amazon, it is an excellent product, which I would highly recommend.~0
much better than the hard plastic cases.~0
If you are looking for a good quality Motorola Headset keep looking, this isn't it.~0
Poor Talk Time Performance.~0
Love this headset!~0
Overall, I am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception.~0
Fix my schedule~1
You have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly.~0
I still maintain that monkeys shouldn't make headphones, we just obviously don't share enough DNA to copy the design over to humans.~0
buy frozen goods at the grocery store~1
I love this bluetooth!~0
Not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses.~0
Not only did the software do a great job of this, I could also make my own ringtones form my existing CDs without an internet connection.~0

This is simply the BEST bluetooth headset for sound quality!~0
This is an excellent tool, especially when paired with your phone's auto-answer.~0
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case.~0
It is light, has plenty of battery capacity, and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time.~0
Pay bills for water and electricity~1
I love this thing!~0
He was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery.~0
My colleague & I now get great reception.A little expensive, but performance is great.~0
The keyboard is a nice compromise between a full QWERTY and the basic cell phone number keypad.~0
I bought two of them and neither will charge.~0
Sprint charges for this service.~0
The keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough I don't expect any problems.~0
Also makes it easier to hold on to.~0
buy additional ingredients~1
This does not fit the Palm Tungsten E2 and it broke the first time I tried to plug it in.~0
It's very attractive and appears to be of good quality.~0
Battery life is also great!~0
All in all, I'd expected a better consumer experience from Motorola.~0

The color is even prettier than I thought it would be, and the graphics are incredibly sharp.~0
After trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well.~0
I was very impressed with the price of the cases.~0
The camera, although rated at an impressive 1.3 megapixels, renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution.~0
You can't beat the price on these.~0

Pay the bills~1
It quit working after I'd used it for about 18 months, so I just purchased another one because this is the best headset I've ever owned.~0
However, BT headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me up.~0
Does not fit.~0

As an earlier review noted, plug in this charger and nothing happens.~0

I could not recommend these more.~0
Worked very well paired with a Treo 700w and as a Skype headset on my PC (using a USB Bluetooth transceiver).~0

.... Item arrived quickly and works great with my Metro PCS Samsung SCH-r450 slider phone and Sony Premium Sound in ear plugs.~0
I would recommend it.~0

The real killer is the volume, and of course it breaking.~0
Plan on ordering from them again and again.~0
Great product and price.~0
I contacted the company and they told me that, although the unit was still under warranty, if I couldn't produce my receipt I was out of luck.~0
After charging overnight, these batteries work great.~0
It's A PIECE OF CRAP!~0
encode report~1
Great Earpiece.~0
Good transmit audio.~0
It holds a charge for a long time, is reasonably comfortable under long-wearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous.~0
However, after about a year, the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and I couldn't receive and place calls.~0

Unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect.~0
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor.~0
Timely shipment and quality product.~0
Unfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentle-touch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening.~0
Phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are.~0
It is cheap, and it feel and look just as cheap.~0
One thing I hate is the mode set button at the side.~0
